            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Developed a sophisticated multithreaded order processing system that simulates a retail environment 
                where multiple producers generate customer orders and multiple consumers process them concurrently. 
                The system demonstrates advanced understanding of parallel programming concepts and thread synchronization.
            </p>
            <p>
                The implementation uses the classic producer-consumer pattern with a shared buffer, ensuring thread-safe 
                access through careful use of POSIX threads, semaphores, and mutexes. This project showcases my ability 
                to build robust concurrent systems that handle real-world scenarios like inventory management and order 
                fulfillment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Completed in May 2025 as part of my coursework in parallel computing, this project required deep 
                understanding of operating system primitives, race condition prevention, and deadlock avoidance.

    <!-- Technical Implementation -->
    <section class="overview-section">
        <div class="container-narrow">
            <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
            <p>
                The system architecture revolves around POSIX threads (pthreads) with careful synchronization using 
                semaphores for buffer counting and mutexes for critical section protection. Producer threads generate 
                orders at varying rates and place them in a bounded circular buffer, while consumer threads retrieve 
                and process orders, updating inventory accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Key challenges included preventing race conditions when multiple threads access shared data structures, 
                implementing proper signaling for producer termination, and ensuring fair scheduling among consumers. 
                I used counting semaphores to track empty and full buffer slots, and a mutex to protect the critical 
                sections where the buffer index is modified.
            </p>
            <p>
                The logging system captures detailed transaction information including thread IDs, timestamps, order 
                details, and inventory changes. File parsing handles initial inventory loading, and output regeneration 
                creates formatted reports showing final inventory state and transaction history.
            </p>
