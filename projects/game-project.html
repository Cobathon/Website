            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Developing a sophisticated turn-based RPG in Unity that showcases advanced AI programming and game 
                systems design. The project demonstrates my ability to implement complex game mechanics including 
                intelligent enemy AI, dynamic turn management, and modular character behavior systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game features enemies with A* pathfinding-based AI that intelligently navigate the battlefield, 
                a Conditional Turn-Based (CTB) system using min-heap data structures for efficient turn order 
                management, and behavior trees that enable flexible and maintainable character decision-making logic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Started in January 2025 and currently in active development, this project combines my computer science 
                background with game design skills from my minor, resulting in a technically sophisticated RPG with 
                engaging gameplay mechanics.

            <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
            <p>
                Behavior trees structure AI decision-making through composite nodes (selectors, sequences) and leaf 
                nodes (actions, conditions). Each enemy type has a customizable behavior tree defining their combat 
                strategy aggressive enemies prioritize attacking, defensive enemies seek cover, and support enemies 
                heal allies. The modular design allows rapid prototyping of new AI personalities without code changes.

            <p>
                The core systems pathfinding AI, CTB turn management, and behavior trees are fully implemented and 
                functional. Current development focuses on expanding content including new character abilities, enemy 
                types, and combat encounters that showcase the AI system's capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Future enhancements include cooperative multi-agent AI where enemies coordinate attacks, improved 
                pathfinding with formation movement, and advanced behavior tree debugging tools. I'm also exploring 
                Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for boss AI that can predict player strategies and adapt accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project demonstrates not just technical proficiency in C# and Unity, but also my ability to 
                design complex interconnected game systems that are both performant and maintainable. The combination 
                of computer science algorithms with game design principles results in engaging, intelligent gameplay.
