            <p>
                Project Promotion is a strategic turn-based RPG featuring intelligent AI systems and complex game mechanics. 
                The game showcases advanced programming techniques including A* pathfinding for enemy navigation, a Conditional 
                Turn-Based (CTB) system using min-heap data structures for efficient turn order management, and modular behavior 
                trees that enable flexible and maintainable character decision-making logic.

            <p>
                As an AI and Gameplay Programmer, I was responsible for implementing core game systems including behavior tree 
                architectures, save/load progression systems, level progression mechanics, and cutscene controllers. The project 
                combines my computer science background with game design skills, resulting in a technically sophisticated RPG 
                with engaging gameplay mechanics that demonstrate both algorithmic thinking and game development expertise.

                <h3>Challenge 1: Learning AI and Behavior Trees from Scratch</h3>
                <p>
                    AI programming and behavior tree architecture were completely new concepts to me when I started this project. 
                    I needed to understand not just how to implement these systems, but also the underlying design patterns and 
                    best practices for creating maintainable, extensible AI architectures.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Engaged in extensive research on behavior tree patterns, AI decision-making systems, and game AI architecture. 
                    Studied existing implementations and design patterns through documentation, tutorials, and academic resources. 
                    Used a trial-and-error approach with iterative prototyping, starting with simple behavior trees and gradually 
                    increasing complexity. Created test scenarios to validate each system component before integration. 
                    Documented learnings and patterns to build a solid foundation for future development.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Successfully implemented a robust behavior tree system that supports complex AI behaviors. The modular 
                    architecture allows for easy extension and modification without breaking existing functionality. The knowledge 
                    gained enabled me to contribute effectively to other AI systems in the project.

                <h3>Challenge 2: Designing Save/Load System for Complex Game State</h3>
                <p>
                    Creating a save/load system that accurately preserves all game state including player progression, character 
                    data, level unlocks, and AI states required careful design to ensure data integrity and system performance.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Designed a serialization system using Unity's built-in serialization capabilities combined with custom data 
                    structures. Created a centralized save manager that coordinates saving and loading across all game systems. 
                    Implemented versioning to handle save file compatibility as the game evolves. Used defensive programming to 
                    handle edge cases and corrupted save files gracefully.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Players can reliably save and resume their progress. The system is extensible, allowing new game systems to 
                    easily integrate with the save/load functionality. Save files remain compatible across game updates through 
                    version management.
                </p>

            <div class="challenge-block">
                <h3>Challenge 3: Integrating Multiple Systems Without Tight Coupling</h3>
                <p>
                    The behavior trees, cutscene controller, level progression, and save/load systems all needed to work together 
                    seamlessly without creating dependencies that would make the codebase difficult to maintain or modify.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Implemented event-driven architecture using C# delegates and events. Systems communicate through well-defined 
                    interfaces rather than direct references. Used Unity's component system to keep systems modular and 
                    independently testable. Created clear separation of concerns where each system has a single responsibility.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Systems can be developed and tested independently. Changes to one system don't require modifications to others. 
                    The architecture supports parallel development by multiple team members without conflicts. Debugging is easier 
                    due to clear system boundaries.

            <h3>Research & Learning Phase</h3>
            <p>
                Spent initial weeks researching behavior tree patterns, AI architecture, and game system design. Studied existing

                nodes (composite and leaf nodes) that could be easily extended for specific behaviors. Prototyped with simple 
                behaviors before implementing complex decision trees.
            </p>

            <h3>Core Systems Implementation</h3>
            <p>
                Implemented save/load system, level progression, and cutscene controller in parallel, ensuring each system had

            <h3>Integration & Testing</h3>
            <p>
                Integrated all systems together, ensuring smooth communication through event-driven architecture. Created test 
                scenarios to validate system interactions and edge cases. Collaborated with team members to ensure systems work 
                well with art, design, and other programming contributions.

                <p>
                    The behavior tree system uses a hierarchical node structure where composite nodes (selectors, sequences) 
                    control flow, and leaf nodes (actions, conditions) perform specific tasks. This architecture enables 
                    complex AI behaviors through composition of simple, reusable components.

                    The save/load system uses Unity's serialization capabilities combined with custom data structures to 
                    preserve game state. A centralized SaveManager coordinates saving and loading across all game systems, 
                    ensuring data consistency and integrity.

                <p>
                    The cutscene controller uses an event-driven architecture to manage narrative sequences and gameplay 
                    transitions. It integrates seamlessly with other systems through well-defined interfaces, allowing 
                    cutscenes to trigger game events and respond to player actions.

                <p>
                    The A* pathfinding implementation uses a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently find optimal paths 
                    through the game world. The algorithm considers terrain costs and movement constraints to calculate 
                    the best route for AI characters.
