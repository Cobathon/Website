            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                I designed and developed a comprehensive e-commerce platform that handles everything from product 
                browsing to secure payment processing. The application was built to support high traffic volumes 
                while maintaining fast load times and a smooth user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                The platform features a modern, responsive design that works seamlessly across all devices, 
                from mobile phones to desktop computers. Special attention was paid to the checkout flow to 
                minimize cart abandonment and maximize conversions.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project involved building both the customer-facing storefront and an admin dashboard for 
                managing products, orders, and inventory in real-time. The system processes thousands of 
                transactions daily with 99.9% uptime.

    <!-- Technical Implementation -->
    <section class="overview-section">
        <div class="container-narrow">
            <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
            <p>
                The frontend was built using React with a component-based architecture for maximum reusability 
                and maintainability. State management is handled through Redux for predictable data flow across 
                the application.
            </p>
            <p>
                The backend API is built with Node.js and Express, utilizing MongoDB for flexible data storage 
                and Redis for caching frequently accessed data. This architecture ensures fast response times 
                even under heavy load.
            </p>
            <p>
                The application is deployed on AWS using a containerized approach with Docker and Kubernetes 
                for easy scaling and deployment. CloudFront CDN is used to serve static assets globally with 
                minimal latency.
